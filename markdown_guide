Another Way To Do Headers 1
===========================
And Header 2
------------

###### Set Custom ID to Header to link to it later {#123}

### Table of Contents
Use custom header IDs to make a TOC.
- [Paragraphs]{#paragraphs}
- [Text Formatting]{#formatting}
- [Lists]{#lists}
- [Blockquotes]{#blockquotes}
- [Codeblocks]{#codeblocks}
- [Elements in Lists]{#listelements}
- [Line Separators]{#separators}
- [Links]{#links}
- [Escaped Characters]{#escaped}
- [Tables]{#tables}
- [Footnotes]{#footnotes}
- [Non-Common Text Formatting]{#uncommon}
- [Commenting Markdown]{#comments}
- [Admonitions]{#admonitions}

### Paragraphs {#paragraphs}
This is how you make paragraphs in Markdown.

Blank lines separate paragraphs.

Line breaks are done  
with 2+ spaces  
at the end of  
each line.  

There isn't a good way of indenting paragraphs since
tab and spaces are taken. If your Markdown processor
supports HTML, you can do something goofy like this:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indented text....?

You can also use HTML to center paragraph text
<center>if you're able to use it.<\center>
The HTML center tag has been deprecated, so it won't work
for much longer if it does now. 
<p style="text-aling:center">CSS might work, but not all allow it.<\p>

### Text Formatting {#formatting}
**Bold**
__Bold__
Use ast**eri**sks for bold inside a word.

*Italicized*
_Italicized_
Use ast*eri*sks for italics inside a word.

***Bold and italic***
___Bold and italic___
__*Bold and italic*__
**_Bold and italic_**

~~Strikethrough~~

Underline using <ins>HTML tags</ins> if they're supported by your Markdown processor.

### Lists {#lists}
Lists need to start with the number 1, but after that the numbers don't matter.
1. First
    1. First.2
    2. First.3
2. Second
3. Third

1. First
1. Second
1. Third

1. First
    - Unordered inside
    - An ordered list
8. Second
4. Third

- First
    - First 2
    - First 3
- Second

* First
* Second

+ First
+ Second

- 1986\. If you need to start
- a list with a number and a period

- [ ] Task
- [x] Lists

### Blockquotes {#blockquotes}
> Blockquotes
> 
> can have multilines, start each line with '>'

> Nested
>
>> Blockquote

> ###### Blockquote Header
> 
> - You can even do
> - bullets in here!
> 
> You can do *most* text formatting in **blockquotes**.

### Codeblocks {#codeblocks}
`This is how you make codeblocks`

    Indent 4 spaces to make
    something a multiline codeblock.

``Double up `if` you want to use backticks.``

```json
You can also make codeblocks
like this.
```

### Elements in Lists {#listelements}
* First
* Second

    Indent this line to have it within the list but not part of it.

* Third
* Fourth
    > Blockquote inside a list.
* Fifth

* First
        Indent codeblocks 8 spaces when in a list
* Second

### Line Separators {#separators}
***
---
___

3+ of the above make a line.
Put spaces around them to keep them from making headers.

### Links {#links}
[Linking to Headers](#123)

[Google](https://www.google.com "The text that shows when you hover over the link.") is a search engine.
<annie@email.com>
<https://make-a-quick-url.com>

Some Markdown processors automatically link URLS. Use backticks to stop that.
`https://www.google.com`

### Escaped Characters {#escaped}
\\
\`
\*
\_
\{ \}
\[ \]
\< \> -> check, not working?
\( \)
\#
\+
\- 
\.
\!
\| -> check, not working?

### Tables {#tables}
| Name | Me |
| ---- | -- | 
| Annie | Yes|
| Widths can | Vary and it's ok |
| Escape Pipes | Using its HTML | char code <br><\br> &#124; |
| HTML lets you | put lists | in your tables: <ul><li>First<\li><li>Second<\li><\ul>|

| Left | Center | Right|
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| Left Aligned | Centered | Right Aligned |

### Footnotes {#footnotes}
Footnotes let you add notes [^1] to your notes for lack of a better word.[^bignote]

[^1]: You put your footnotes down here
[^bignote]: And they auto-link from your
    above text to here.
    Use indents to include extra lines in the footnote.

    Add as much text as you like to the bignote footnote.

### Non-Common Text Formatting {#uncommon}
Not all Markdown processors let you do these, but keeping note because they're useful.

Use emojis like most other places :joy:

Highlighting ==important stuff==.

Subscript for chemicals - H~2~0

Superscript for maths - 2^4^

### Commenting Markdown {#comments}
You can add comments
[to Markdown that]: #
will not show when rendered.

### Admonitions {#admonitions}
> :warning: **Warning**: This is what a warning block looks like.

> :memo: **Note**: This is what a note block looks like.

> :bulb: **Tip**: Lightbulbs give you ideas!
